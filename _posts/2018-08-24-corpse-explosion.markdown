**1st-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)

**Duration**: 1 minute

A bubble of corpse rot bursts, covering the ground with slick effluent in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turning it into difficult terrain for the duration.

When the rot appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fall prone and become poisoned. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fall prone and become poisoned. Any creature poisoned by this spell may make another Constitution save at the end of each of it's turns. On a success, the poisoned condition ends.

If the targeted area contains an actual corpse, the area is increased to a 15-foot square and all creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
