**3rd-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a pair of rat bones)

**Duration**: Concentraion, up to 10 minutes

You create six spears of bone in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell’s duration. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the spears, sending them streaking toward a creature or creatures you choose within 120 feet of you. Roll a spell attack against each target - if the target is hit, they take 2d12 piercing damage.

If you choose to consume a corpse within 5ft of you when this spell is cast, the spell creates two additional spears.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.
